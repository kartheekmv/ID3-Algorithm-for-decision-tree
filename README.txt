We have Implemented Decision Tree Construction and Post Pruning Algorithm in java.

Steps for Execution:

1)Open the java file in any IDE, We have used Eclipse IDE.
2)Goto run -> run configurations.
3)Open the run configuration and in the arguments tab enter the first argument 
as path for training_set, second argument as validation_set, third argument as test_set and lastly
pruning factor (For Example 0.05).

Ex:- Pathofdata_set\training_set.csv Pathofdata_set\validation_set.csv Pathofdata_set\test_set.csv 0.05

4) Firstly the normal tree is printed before pruning.
4) Next, Pruned tree is printed after applying the post pruning algorithm.
5) Lastly, Accuracies of the Training data, validation data and test data before pruning and after pruning is printed.
